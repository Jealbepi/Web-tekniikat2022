                    Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth,
                    approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

                                The Doom Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal to Outland, flooding Azeroth with the ravenous demons of the Burning Legion. 
                                Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance, reinforced by their new blood elf and draenei allies, 
                                passed through the gateway to stop the invasion at its source. On Outland's desiccated Hellfire Peninsula,

                                while the Horde made contact with the Mag'har (uncorrupted) orcs who had not participated in their race's original invasion of Azeroth. 
                                The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and 
                                the lieutenants of Illidan Stormrage, who had claimed the shattered realm for his own.

                                Warchief Thrall deployed an expedition force to Northrend led by Overlord Garrosh Hellscream. Meanwhile, 
                                the missing human king Varian Wrynn at last returned to Stormwind City and reclaimed his crown.

                                which took place more than two decades earlier, Deathwing has spent that time healing himself, 
                                and plotting his fiery return from the elemental plane of Deepholm. His return tears through 
                                the dimensional barrier within Azeroth, causing a sweeping cataclysm that reshapes much of the world's surface. 
                                In the midst of the worldwide disaster comes renewed conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, 
                                which is now under the rule of Garrosh Hellscream. With the elemental realms now open to the world,

                                causing worldwide violence between the factions to erupt anew. A destructive naval skirmish left Alliance and Horde 
                                forces washed ashore on the fog-shrouded island of Pandaria, which had appeared in the open sea, defying modern maps and charts. 
                                As both warring factions established footholds on the resource-rich continent, they made contact with the noble pandaren, 
                                one of its most prolific peoples. This ancient race worked with the Alliance and Horde in the hopes of dispersing the Sha: dark,

                                  Alliance and Horde force and taken into custody by the Pandaren so that he can stand trial for the atrocities he committed in Pandaria. 
                                  However, before he can be judged, Garrosh escapes captivity with the aid of Kairozdormu (a renegade bronze dragon) and travels 
                                  to the orcish homeworld of Draenor 35 years in the past, prior to the rise of the Horde. As soon as they arrive Garrosh kills Kairoz 
                                  then proceeds to change history by preventing his father Grommash from drinking the blood of the demon lord Mannoroth, 
                                  which led to the orc's corruption by the Burning Legion and played a major role in the events of the first three Warcraft games. 
                                  This interferes with history, creating an alternate timeline where the orcish clans unite into an "Iron Horde" by using technology 
                                  Garrosh brought from his time. The Iron Horde begin a war of conquest on Draenor by killing Mannoroth and building a Dark Portal

                                  into the planet Azeroth. This not only devastated a massive area (much of the desert zone of Silithus is now cracked and scorched), 
                                  but badly wounded the gestating titan inside. While the heroes managed to ablate the worst of the damage 
                                  (at the cost of the majority of their artifact weapons' mythic power), the world is still wounded and bleeding a substance called
                                   "Azerite," which has great magical potential. The Horde Warchief, Sylvanas Windrunner, attempts to consolidate Horde power on 
                                   Kalimdor and gain a monopoly on Azerite (which is primarily found at the southern end of the continent).<br>

                                   The Alliance makes a retaliatory strike against her home base, the Undercity, which was formerly the human capital of Lordaeron. 
                                   After a long, drawn-out battle, which includes Sylvanas revealing a powerful Azerite weapon and High Overlord Varok Saurfang 
                                   being captured by Alliance champions, the Horde is pushed back to the throne room and is eventually driven out entirely. 
                                   As a parting gift, however, Sylvanas saturates the area with disease and toxins that render the kingdom uninhabitable. 
                                   With this tit-for-tat military exchange, the Horde has almost complete control over Kalimdor, while the Alliance has near-total 
                                   dominion over the Eastern Kingdoms. With further conflict inevitable, Battle for Azeroth takes the two factions to 
                                   the continents of Kul Tiras and Zandalar where they attempt to recruit new allies in order to turn the tides of war.

                                  (at the end of Battle for Azeroth), she traveled to Icecrown Citadel and destroyed the Lich King's Helm of Domination, 
                                  which tears a rift in the sky above Icecrown, leading to the Shadowlands, the realm of the dead. Dark angelic figures kidnap 
                                  King Anduin Wrynn, former Warchief Thrall, tauren chieftain Baine Bloodhoof and Lady Jaina Proudmoore and hold them in Torghast, 
                                  the maze-like Tower of the Damned within the Maw. The Cult of the Damned, previously aligned with the Scourge, are now in 
                                  the service of the "Banished One", and conduct attacks in Icecrown and elsewhere. Aided by Azeroth's champions, 
                                  Tyrande Whisperwind - empowered by the moon goddess Elune as the "Night Warrior", the avatar of Elune's vengeance, 
                                  after the burning of the World Tree Teldrassil - confronts Sylvanas' consort, Nathanos Blightcaller, outside his former 
                                  homestead in the Eastern Plaguelands of Lordaeron. After he refuses to tell her where Sylvanas is, Tyrande kills him.
