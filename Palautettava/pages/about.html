                    Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth,
                    approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

                                The Doom Lord Kazzak reopened the Dark Portal to Outland, flooding Azeroth with the ravenous demons of the Burning Legion. 
                                Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance, reinforced by their new blood elf and draenei allies, 
                                passed through the gateway to stop the invasion at its source. On Outland's desiccated Hellfire Peninsula, 
                                the Alliance discovered several of their heroes who had crossed through the portal many years before, 
                                while the Horde made contact with the Mag'har (uncorrupted) orcs who had not participated in their race's original invasion of Azeroth. 
                                The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and 
                                the lieutenants of Illidan Stormrage, who had claimed the shattered realm for his own.

                                <div class="accordion-body">In the wake of the Sunwell's purification, a period of suspicious silence swept over the world. 
                                As if on cue, the undead Scourge launched a massive assault against the cities and towns of Azeroth, 
                                this time extending its reach far beyond the Eastern Kingdoms. Under pressure to respond with a full army, 
                                Warchief Thrall deployed an expedition force to Northrend led by Overlord Garrosh Hellscream. Meanwhile, 
                                the missing human king Varian Wrynn at last returned to Stormwind City and reclaimed his crown. 
                                He sent an equally powerful Alliance army, commanded by Bolvar Fordragon, to defeat the Lich King and any 
                                Horde forces who would stand in their way. <br>
                                <br>
                                The Alliance and Horde (led by Dranosh Saurfang) eventually led a combined offensive on the Wrathgate, 
                                the entrance to the Lich King's fortress of Icecrown Citadel. Before they could succeed, however, 
                                Grand Apothecary Putress and his Royal Apothecary Society followers (renegade Forsaken) unleashed a new plague 
                                that killed friend and foe alike, while his traitorous counterpart, the dreadlord Varimathras, 
                                seized the Undercity in a coup that nearly killed Sylvanas. The usurpers were slain for their vile deeds by 
                                armies of the Alliance and Horde and the Forsaken capital was restored. The debacle, however, created suspicion 
                                among the Horde regarding Sylvanas's loyalties. At the Wrathgate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at 
                                the hands of the Forsaken's Royal Apothecary Society; including King Varian's dear friend Bolvar Fordragon. 
                                Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the new plague for years. 
                                The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde 
                                had been left unchecked for too long and he becomes hostile to the Horde for the rest of the campaign in Northrend.

                                which took place more than two decades earlier, Deathwing has spent that time healing himself, 
                                and plotting his fiery return from the elemental plane of Deepholm. His return tears through 
                                the dimensional barrier within Azeroth, causing a sweeping cataclysm that reshapes much of the world's surface. 
                                In the midst of the worldwide disaster comes renewed conflict between the Alliance and the Horde,
